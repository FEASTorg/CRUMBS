# CRUMBS Roadmap

**Note:** Items ordered by value/feasibility. No commitment is made regarding timing or whether any specific item will be implemented.

---

## ESP32 Platform Support

**Goal:** Enable ESP32 for IoT/gateway applications (likely works immediately via Arduino Wire compatibility)

**Value:** High — ESP32 is extremely popular with built-in WiFi/BLE for gateway use cases  
**Feasibility:** Very high — Arduino Wire API compatible, minimal validation needed  
**Effort:** Low — Primarily documentation and testing

**Deliverables:**

- Platform validation: ESP32-DevKitC, ESP32-S3 at 100kHz–1MHz
- Documentation: GPIO mappings (GPIO21/22), dual-core thread safety, gateway patterns
- Examples: `hello_peripheral`, `hello_controller`, minimal WiFi bridge
- CI: PlatformIO build validation

---

## Performance & Benchmarking

**Goal:** Quantitative performance data for validation and regression testing

**Value:** High — Validates design claims, enables regression detection, provides concrete metrics for users  
**Feasibility:** High — Measures existing functionality, no new features required  
**Effort:** Medium — Benchmark suite development and cross-platform testing

**Deliverables:**

- Benchmark suite: encode/decode, handler dispatch, CRC-8, memory footprint
- `docs/performance.md` with platform results (AVR, ESP32, Linux)
- Target: 1000 msg/sec @ 100kHz I²C on Arduino Nano; <3KB flash, <200B RAM
- CI integration: automated benchmarks, regression tracking

---

## Error Recovery Patterns

**Goal:** Document robust error handling for production systems

**Value:** High — Critical for production deployments, helps users build reliable systems  
**Feasibility:** High — Documentation-focused, no core library changes  
**Effort:** Medium — Comprehensive guide and reference implementation

**Deliverables:**

- `docs/error-recovery.md` – Retry strategies, exponential backoff, circuit breaker patterns, timeout configuration
- `examples/patterns/robust_controller/` – Reference implementation
- Optional helper functions for common patterns

---

## Python Controller Tools

**Goal:** Rapid prototyping and automation with Python (controller-only)

**Value:** Medium-High — Lowers barrier to entry, enables rapid prototyping and integration  
**Feasibility:** High — Controller-only scope, well-defined protocol  
**Effort:** Medium-High — Package development, CLI tools, testing infrastructure

**Deliverables:**

- PyPI package: `pip install crumbs-i2c` (encode/decode, CRC-8, I²C via smbus2)
- CLI tools: `crumbs-scan`, `crumbs-send`, `crumbs-query`
- `docs/python-quickstart.md` with integration examples (pandas, Flask)
- pytest suite with LHWIT validation

**Example:**

```python
from crumbs_controller import CrumbsController
bus = CrumbsController("/dev/i2c-1")
devices = bus.scan()  # {0x10: 0x03, 0x20: 0x01}
bus.send(0x20, type_id=0x01, opcode=0x01, data=[0xFF])
```

## Linux Peripheral Support

**Status:** I²C slave mode requires kernel driver development ([technical details](https://github.com/FEASTorg/linux-wire/blob/main/docs/slave-mode-investigation.md)). Alternative transports needed for Linux peripheral support.

**Value:** Medium — Enables Raspberry Pi as peripheral, but microcontrollers better suited for this role  
**Feasibility:** Low (I²C) / Medium (Serial) — Kernel driver required OR new transport layer  
**Effort:** High — Either kernel module (beyond scope) or transport abstraction (substantial architecture change)

### Alternative Approaches

#### Option A: Serial/UART (Most Feasible)

- User-space support via `/dev/ttyS*`, `/dev/ttyUSB*`, USB CDC/ACM
- No kernel development required
- **Implementation:** Transport abstraction layer (`crumbs_serial.c`) with same message format
- **Use case:** Raspberry Pi as USB/serial CRUMBS peripheral

#### Option B: Network/TCP

- WiFi/Ethernet connectivity for wireless CRUMBS networks
- Standard sockets API, full user-space support
- **Trade-off:** Network overhead vs wireless capability
- **Use case:** Raspberry Pi Zero W as wireless bridge

#### Option C: Custom Kernel Module

- Full I²C slave functionality with event-driven architecture
- **Verdict:** Beyond CRUMBS core library scope (requires kernel expertise, distribution complexity)

### Implementation Path (if pursuing Serial)

**Files:**

- `src/transports/crumbs_serial.c` - Transport layer abstraction
- `src/hal/linux/crumbs_linux_serial.c` - Linux serial HAL
- `examples/core_usage/linux/serial_peripheral/`

**Documentation:**

- `docs/transport-layers.md` - I²C vs Serial architecture
- Update `docs/platform-setup.md` with serial setup

**Success Criteria:**

- Same CRUMBS handlers work on both I²C and serial transports
- Raspberry Pi peripheral via USB CDC/ACM

## Reference Family Expansion

**Goal:** Additional reference implementations beyond LHWIT (LED/Servo/Calculator/Display)

**Value:** Low-Medium — More examples helpful but LHWIT already demonstrates patterns  
**Feasibility:** Medium — Requires hardware, full implementation stack  
**Effort:** High — Each family needs peripheral + controller + docs + hardware validation

**Context:** A "family" is a device category with shared type_id, opcodes, and handler patterns (e.g., LHWIT defines how LED modules communicate).

**Potential Families:**

- **Sensors:** Temperature (DHT22, BMP280), humidity, pressure – periodic polling patterns
- **Motor Control:** DC/stepper motors – motion control, homing sequences
- **Protocol Bridges:** UART/SPI over I²C – translation and buffering patterns

**Note:** Community-driven based on actual user requests. Each family requires significant effort (peripheral + controller + docs + hardware).

## Explicitly Out of Scope

### Gateway Services

Building REST/MQTT/WebSocket services is **application territory**, not library scope. Different users need different protocols. Better approach: document integration patterns, provide minimal examples, let community build gateways.

**Alternative:** `docs/integration-patterns.md` showing how to use CRUMBS in Flask routes, MQTT publishers, etc.

### Multi-Family Bus Sharing

"One family per bus" is a **core design principle** providing compile-time type safety. Dynamic vocabulary discovery adds complexity for rare use cases. Real solution: use multiple I²C buses or bus bridging.

**Alternative:** Document the constraint clearly and provide multi-bus setup examples if requested.

### Enhanced Discovery Protocols

Current discovery (version query via opcode 0x00) is sufficient. Capability negotiation, hierarchical addressing, and multicast add protocol complexity without demonstrated user need.

**Alternative:** Wait for actual pain points; if needed, module families can extend version query payload.
